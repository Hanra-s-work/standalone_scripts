## Versioning
>
> When I bring big iterations to a script, I change the number, script versions are generally retro-compatible because I build upon the previous one.
>
> Here the version number does not mean much appart from helping you track the different versions of the script.
>
> If there is a breaking change, this will be told in the changelog of the version

V1.0.0:
> This is the initial script that deploys a docker container with scc and runs it against your current directory (the one you ran it from)
