# DeepSeek Docker Deployment Script

>    Script written by Henry Letellier

This script is used to deploy DeepSeek (currently, the default version is 14B, but you can change the variable to 7B, which is commented out).  

The script is "intelligent"â€”meaning it checks whether the Docker container exists and is running:  
- If it exists and is running, it puts you inside the container.  
- Otherwise, it checks if the image is available:  
  - If it is, it deploys the container and puts you inside.  
  - If not, it generates a Dockerfile in `/tmp/deep-seek`, builds the image, deploys the container, and puts you inside.  

Once inside the container, you can run the `start_model` script to launch the AI. Otherwise, a BusyBox shell is available in the container for exploration. The script relies on the following environment variables:  
- `MODEL_WEIGHT` (default: 14B)  
- `MODEL_NAME` (default: deepseek-r1)  

### Script Configuration Options:  

*    `-h, --help` : Display this help message.  
*    `-m, --model-name` : The model name to use. Default: `deepseek-r1`  
*    `-w, --model-weight` : The model weight to use. Default: `7b`  
*    `-c, --container-name` : The container name to use. Default: `deep-seek-container`  
*    `-i, --image-name` : The image name to use. Default: `deep-seek-image`  
*    `-d, --dockerfile-location-folder` : The folder where the Dockerfile is stored. Default: `/tmp/deep-seek`  
*    `-o, --ollama-cache-location-folder` : The folder where the Ollama cache is stored. Default: `ollama_cache`  
*    `-p, --ollama-host-port` : The host port for Ollama. Default: `11434`  
*    `-v, --ollama-version` : The version of Ollama to use. Default: `0.5.7`  
*    `-g, --use-gpu` : Use the GPU for the container. Default: `true`  
*    `-gp, --use-gpu-portion` : The portion of the GPU to use. Default: `all`  

In short, no installation is required for a fully local AI (aside from the initial model download).
